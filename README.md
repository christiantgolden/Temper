# Temper
A meditative experience on the persuit of temperance, balance, equilibrium. Temper (in both its Temper.py and GoldenRatio.py forms) is being developed in the Python programming language, using the PyGame library.

If you plan to run either of the .py files, you must have downloaded the SourceCodPro-Regular.ttf font, and installed Python 3.x and PyGame. 

<pre>
Do not be overly righteous,
Nor be overly wise:
Why should you destroy yourself?
Do not be overly wicked,
Nor be foolish:
Why should you die before your time?

          Ecclesiastes 7:16-17 - KJV
